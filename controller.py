    r"""A deterministic reformulation of a linear chance constrained MPC
    that uses a discrete linear state space model of the system.
    The original stochastic problem is given by:

    .. math::
        \displaystyle \underset{u}{\min}
        \quad
        & \mathbb{E}
        \left[
            \sum_{i=0}^{P-1}
                \left(
                e_i^T Q e_i + u_i^T R u_i
                \right)
        \right] \\
        x_{k+1} &= A x_k + B u_k \\
        e_k &= r - x_k \\
        P
        \left[
            d x_k + e \ge 0
        \right]
        &\ge p
        \quad \forall \; 0 \le k < N

    where :math:`Q` and :math:`R` are tuning parameters,
    :math:`A` and :math:`B`
    are state space matrices,
    :math:`r` is the set point,
    and :math:`P[c] \ge p`
    ensures that the probability of :math:`c` is larger than :math:`p`.

    The reformulation is done by Wilken (2015) and the deterministic problem
    is given by:

    .. math::
        \displaystyle \underset{u}{\min}
        \quad
        & \sum_{i=0}^{P-1}
        \left(
        e_i^T Q e_i + u_i^T R u_i
        \right)	\\
        \mu_{k+1} &= A \mu_k + B u_k \\
        e_k &= r - \mu_k \\
        \Sigma_{k+1} &= A \Sigma_k A^T + W
        \quad \forall \; 0 \le k < N \\
        d \mu_k + e &\ge k \sqrt{d \Sigma_k d^T}
        \quad \forall \; 0 \le k < N

    where :math:`\mu` is the state estimated mean,
    :math:`k` is a constant that depends on :math:`p`,
    :math:`\Sigma_k` is the covariance prediction,
    :math:`\Sigma_0` is the state estimated covariance,
    and :math:`W` is the covariance for the state noise.
